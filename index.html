        <h2>Local Spotlight - Fortescue (Film)</h2>
        <p>      
          The Globe & Mail calls it. “a layered exploration of female friendship, illness and the artistic process”. 
          We call it ‘ours’. Sometimes referred to as ‘the Emily Dickinson of Rosedale’, Fortescue cottager, Writer and Director, Rebeccah Love, has filmed her first feature-length movie using our lake as its backdrop. 
          <br><br>
          Beautifully shot in and around Lake Fortescue in the late summer/early fall of 2023, her rustic family cottage becomes Ground Zero for this dramatic, heartfelt tale of magical proportions. 
          And what a thrill for us to see our lake so lovingly portrayed in its natural setting!
          It’s a must-see reminder of how lucky we are to be surrounded by such an awe-inspiring setting.

    <!-- Brief History -->
    <section id="history">
      <h1>A Short History of Lake Fortescue</h1>
      <p>
        Logging brought the first wave of development to the Fortescue area in the late 1800s.
        When lumbering declined, early homesteads gave way to seasonal cottages. By the 1950s
        improved roads turned Fortescue into a favourite retreat for families seeking the peace
        and quiet of the Kawarthas. 
        <br><br> 
        In 1976 the Lake Fortescue Cottagers’ Association (LFCA)
        was founded to protect the lake environment and foster community spirit—values. These goals 
        continue to guide us today.
